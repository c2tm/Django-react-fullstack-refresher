JWT (JSON Web Token) Token:
    -Used in backend request to authenticate user

Flow:
    -Credentials sent to backend
    -Backend sends refresh and access Token. Access token is refreshed with refresh token, and 
     is used to access backend. 
     Once refresh token expires, new set is needed.

ORM (Object Relational Mapping) ===>
    - Maps python objects to corresponding code that needs to be executed to make database changes.

User Serializer, View next, Connect Urls

Next, make migrations ===> python manage.py makemigrattions
    - Creates file that tells django the migrations needed to be made.

Follow up with migrate ===> python manage.py migrate
